Soothe the young man's sweating forehead <br>
Touch the naked stem held hidden there <br>
Safe in such dark hayseed wired nest<br>
Then his light brown eyes are quick<br>
Once touch is what he thought was grip<br>
<br>
'Tis not his hands those there but mine<br>
And safe, my hands do seek to gain<br>
All knowledge of my master's manly rain<br>
The scented taste that stills my tongue<br>
Is wrong that is set but not undone<br>
<br>
His fiery eyes can slash my savage skin<br>
And force all seriousness away<br>
He wades in close waters<br>
Deep sleep alters his senses<br>
I must obey my only rival<br>
<br>
He will command our twin revival<br>
The same insane sustain again<br>
(The two of us so close to our own hearts)<br>
I silence and wrote<br>
This awe of coincidence<br>
<br>
